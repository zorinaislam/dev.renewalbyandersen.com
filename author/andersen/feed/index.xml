										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever-evolving world of online security, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) have become essential tools for safeguarding personal information and bypassing geo-restrictions. As of 2024, several top-paid VPN services stand out for their exceptional security features, user-friendly interfaces, and advanced functionalities. These services, including NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, IPVanish, and Atlas VPN, offer varied strengths catering to different user needs. From robust encryption and high-speed streaming capabilities to unlimited device connections and integrated antivirus, each service provides a unique combination of features. Choosing the right VPN depends on individual requirements, whether for privacy, streaming, speed, or overall security.</p>
<p>As of 2024, there are several top-paid VPN services that stand out for their enhanced online security, performance, and features. Here are some of the notable ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NordVPN</strong>: Registered in Panama, it costs about $13 per month with various discounts for longer-term plans. NordVPN supports up to six simultaneous connections and offers features like split tunneling. It boasts a large server network with over 5,200 servers across 60 countries. NordVPN is known for its strong privacy focus with multiple encryption protocols and a commitment to user security.</li>
<li><strong>ExpressVPN</strong>: Based in the British Virgin Islands, ExpressVPN&#8217;s cost starts at $13 per month, with annual plans offering better value. It supports up to five devices simultaneously and has over 3,000 servers in 160 locations across 94 countries. ExpressVPN is recognized for its high speeds, making it ideal for streaming and downloading large files. It supports a wide range of clients, including smart TVs and gaming consoles.</li>
<li><strong>Surfshark</strong>: Known for its excellent value-for-money, Surfshark has over 3,200 servers in 100 countries and offers unlimited simultaneous connections. It starts from as low as $1.99 per month, depending on the plan. Surfshark includes an ad and malware blocker, and it follows a no-logs policy. This service is especially beneficial for streaming, as it can unblock major services and maintain high speeds.</li>
<li><strong>IPVanish</strong>: Starting at $11.99 per month, IPVanish is notable for including antivirus protection in its annual plan. It offers unlimited devices, fast speeds, and a 30-day money-back guarantee. However, it has shown some performance issues on iPhones and is based in the United States, which might raise concerns for those wary of data requests from US authorities.</li>
<li><strong>Atlas VPN</strong>: A newer entrant in the market, Atlas VPN offers competitive features like unlimited simultaneous connections, advanced encryption, and effective ad, tracker, and malware blocking. It&#8217;s noted for its affordability and strong performance, though it faces some limitations in unblocking Netflix in certain regions and has a few connection issues on Windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these VPNs has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, catering to different needs like streaming, speed, privacy, or device compatibility. It&#8217;s important to choose a VPN service that aligns with your specific requirements, whether it&#8217;s for general browsing, streaming, gaming, or security-focused tasks​​​​​​​​​​.</p>

<p>While internet service providers typically offer router and modem setups, opting for your own router can often lead to enhanced home network performance and coverage. With numerous options flooding the market, some routers stand out as top contenders for 2024.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>TP-Link Archer AX21</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Priced under $100, the TP-Link Archer AX21 delivers affordability and supports speeds of up to Gigabit. Featuring EasyMesh, a user-friendly mesh network setup, this router competes admirably with more expensive alternatives without compromising on performance. With full Wi-Fi 6 support and compatibility with Alexa, it offers speeds of up to 1.8 Gbps and a four-antenna system to extend coverage throughout your home. For a reliable router that won&#8217;t necessitate an upgrade for years to come, TP-Link is a solid starting point.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Synology WRX560</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Synology WRX560 comes at a higher price point than the TP-Link but justifiably so, as it boasts full dual-band support for Wi-Fi 6 and the potential for internet connections of up to 2.5 Gbps. This router is essentially future-proof, ready to handle high-speed internet when available. Notably, it supports multiple network IDs, enabling specific configurations for computers, gaming consoles, or smartphones. It also includes built-in parental controls, a VPN system, and seamless integration into a mesh system for comprehensive home coverage, making it a recommendation from PCMag.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Netgear Orbi RBK852 Mesh Router</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For large homes or offices requiring extensive Wi-Fi coverage, a mesh router is an ideal choice. Mesh routers combine the power of two systems to expand coverage without compromising speed or connectivity. The Netgear Orbi RBK852 excels in this regard, as it includes both a router and a satellite extender. This setup can cover up to 5,000 square feet and connect up to 100 devices, ensuring all your smart devices have internet access. While it comes at a higher price point, the support for speeds up to 6 Gbps ensures your home network remains future-proof.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>ASUS ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 Gaming Router</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If gaming takes center stage in your internet activities, investing in a gaming router can significantly enhance your experience. The ASUS ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 is among the best options, tailored specifically for gamers. It features triple-level game acceleration, network security without subscription fees, and support for speeds up to 10 Gbps and 2.5 Gbps, depending on the port you use. The router&#8217;s internals are designed with gaming in mind, making tasks like port forwarding and internet connection customization seamless. While it comes at a higher cost, the ASUS ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 is highly praised for its performance and features by PCMag.</p>
<p>Whether you prioritize affordability, future-proofing, extensive coverage, or gaming optimization, these routers offer top-notch solutions to meet your specific needs in 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CES 2024 was a whirlwind of exciting product launches and technological innovations. Among the numerous announcements, PC enthusiasts were treated to a wide array of new peripherals and the much-anticipated release of Nvidia&#8217;s Super 40 Series GPUs. While not every showcased product left a lasting impression, I&#8217;d like to highlight three of the most captivating PC tech revelations from the event.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ROG NUC Gaming PC: Compact Powerhouse</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In a departure from the traditional bulky gaming rigs that have dominated the PC gaming landscape, CES 2024 introduced us to the ROG NUC gaming PC. This compact marvel boasts the option of an Intel Core Ultra 9 or Core Ultra 7 processor paired with a Nvidia RTX 4060 or 4070 GPU. With configurations supporting up to 32GB of RAM, the ROG NUC offers the potential to replace cumbersome gaming setups with a sleek, space-saving alternative.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Nvidia RTX 40 Super Series GPUs: Enhanced Performance, Affordable Pricing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A standout moment of CES 2024 was the unveiling of Nvidia&#8217;s RTX 40 Super series GPUs. While these next-gen GPUs deliver incremental improvements over their predecessors (the 4070, 4070 Ti, and 4080 cards), they do so at a significantly more budget-friendly price point. The RTX 4070 Super, in particular, elevates Nvidia&#8217;s midrange GPU offerings while maintaining an attractive price tag.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>ASUS BTF Ecosystem: Simplifying PC Building</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>ASUS went beyond showcasing a new gaming PC; they introduced the ASUS BTF (back to the future) ecosystem, aiming to streamline the PC building process for both seasoned builders and newcomers. This comprehensive ecosystem includes thoughtfully designed cases, motherboards, and graphics cards that facilitate cable management by allowing cables to be concealed behind the motherboard, rather than in front of it. ASUS&#8217;s innovative approach has piqued curiosity about the possibilities it holds for future PC builds.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions:</p>
<p>While these three tech innovations stole the spotlight, CES 2024 had no shortage of fascinating exhibits. The MSI Claw and the upcoming HP Transcend 32 were among the notable mentions. The HP Transcend 32, in particular, offers an impressive 32-inch monitor with KVM support, promising to enhance your desk setup significantly. For a deeper dive into more intriguing and unconventional gaming gear from CES 2024, you can refer to fellow Lifehacker writer Pranay Parab&#8217;s comprehensive guide.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trade-ins offer a budget-friendly way to keep up with the latest tech trends, allowing you to exchange your old devices for credit towards new ones. Whether it&#8217;s a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or any gadget, trade-ins can significantly offset your expenses or even eliminate them altogether.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trade-ins offer a budget-friendly way to keep up with the latest tech trends, allowing you to exchange your old devices for credit towards new ones. Whether it&#8217;s a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or any gadget, trade-ins can significantly offset your expenses or even eliminate them altogether.</p>
<p>However, the success of your trade-in largely depends on the condition of the device you&#8217;re parting with. Even with protective cases and screen guards, wear and tear can occur over time. Most trade-in services expect devices to be fully functional and free from major cosmetic damage. The worse the condition, the lower the trade-in value you&#8217;ll receive.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: Your device is in impeccable condition, and you&#8217;ve accurately described its condition in the trade-in survey. You carefully package it, send it off, and eagerly await the buyer&#8217;s confirmation. To your surprise, you receive an email claiming that the received device doesn&#8217;t match the condition you stated. There are dents, scratches, a damaged display, non-functional buttons, or the device won&#8217;t power on. Consequently, the trade-in offer is reduced because it was initially based on your survey&#8217;s device description. While you can appeal, you lack proof that the device was in good condition when you shipped it.</p>
<h2>The Solution: Document Your Devices Before Trading Them In</h2>
<p>To safeguard your trade-ins and ensure you receive the deserved value, documentation is key. Before packing and shipping your device, take photographs and video footage from various angles to demonstrate its pristine condition. These visuals serve as evidence of the device&#8217;s immaculate appearance and functionality.</p>
<p>Consider capturing the device in action; turn it on, unlock it, and showcase that it operates seamlessly. Demonstrating that the charger works is also a wise move. Plug your device into power and exhibit how it initiates charging. For added security, record the device&#8217;s serial number in your video to eliminate any doubts about the device&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>This proactive approach can save you from potential disputes or issues down the line. While you can&#8217;t control what happens to your device during transit or once it leaves your possession, having documented proof of its condition before packaging gives you a significant advantage.</p>
<p>A recent post on r/samsung underscores the importance of this practice. The poster recommended that Galaxy users document their devices before trade-ins. In the same thread, users shared helpful anecdotes, such as one user who successfully refuted a claim of a cracked display by providing photographic and video evidence.</p>
<p>While this article focuses on tech devices, the practice of documenting your items before trade-in or sale applies to a wide range of goods, from electronics to equipment to collectibles. Protect yourself from unwarranted claims or disputes by investing an extra minute or two during the packing process to thoroughly document your trade-ins. It&#8217;s a simple yet effective insurance policy should the need ever arise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, here are seven cloud storage services that were known to be cheaper than iCloud, Google One, and OneDrive. Please keep in mind that pricing and features can change over time, so it&#8217;s essential to verify the current offerings before making a decision. Also, the availability of these services might vary by region.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>pCloud</strong>: pCloud offers competitive pricing and secure cloud storage. They have a one-time payment option for a lifetime subscription, making it a cost-effective choice in the long run.</li>
